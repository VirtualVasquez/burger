# Eat-Da-Burger 

## Description

*Eat-Da-Burger* is a seemingly simple application. Users can submit a new burger into the form, then have it appear on the left side of the page with a "Devour it!" button right next to it. If the "Devour it!" button is pressed, the selected burger is moved to the right side of the page, with no buttons beside it. The right side of the page will also display any and all other burgers that have been devoured by all previous users. 

## Demo

Due to the implementation of Node.js, Express, and MySQL database, the website is deployed on Heroku. Try the website [here.](https://sleepy-fortress-91819.herokuapp.com/)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to integrate the use of a database and express-handlebars.js alongside Express and Node.js, essentially becoming a MySQL Full Stack application. The incorporation of a database makes it possible for the the app to save the actions of multiple users after they've left page and store information that may hold relevance, interest, or importance to those on the back-end. 

The value of using Express-Handlebars is that it allows the creation of webpages that are dynamic and can better coordinate with a database, thus allowing an application to be created with less redudant and manually created code, as well as having the capacity to be scaled and modified as necessary without too much difficulty.
